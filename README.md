# User-Based-Recommendation-Model-for-Amazon

Project Summary:
The aim of the project is to do Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to the dataset and also to build a machine learning recommendation algorithm which provides the ratings for each of the users in the dataset.

Objectives
•	Find movies that have maximum views/ratings
•	Find average rating for each movie
•	Find top 5 movies with the maximum ratings
•	Find top 5 movies with the least audience
•	Build a Machine Learning model for the dataset

Project Background:
	The dataset contains movie reviews given by Amazon customers. Reviews were given between May 1996 and July 2014. All the users have not watched all the movies and therefore, all movies are not rated. These missing values are represented by NA. Ratings are on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is the least rating and 5 is the best.
